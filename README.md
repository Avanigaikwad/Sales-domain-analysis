# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis  

This project demonstrates how to analyze a **Coffee Shop Sales dataset** using **MySQL queries** and validate the results with a **Power BI visualization dashboard**.  

The goal is to:  
1. Import raw sales data into MySQL.  
2. Clean and transform data (fix schema, convert dates/times).  
3. Write SQL queries to calculate KPIs such as total sales, orders, and product performance.  
4. Cross-check query outputs with **Power BI visuals** to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## 🗄️ Database Setup (MySQL)
1. Create the database:
   ```sql
   create database coffee_shop_sales_db;
   use coffee_shop_sales_db;
   ```
2. Import the dataset into MySQL.  
3. Run `schema.sql` to:  
   - Fix column names  
   - Convert `transaction_date` and `transaction_time` to proper data types  
   - Prepare table for analysis  

4. Run queries from `coffee_shop_sales.sql` for analysis and KPI calculation.
