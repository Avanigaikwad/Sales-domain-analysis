# â˜• Coffee Shop Sales Analysis  

This project demonstrates how to analyze a **Coffee Shop Sales dataset** using **MySQL queries** and validate the results with a **Power BI visualization dashboard**.  

The goal is to:  
1. Import raw sales data into MySQL.  
2. Clean and transform data (fix schema, convert dates/times).  
3. Write SQL queries to calculate KPIs such as total sales, orders, and product performance.  
4. Cross-check query outputs with **Power BI visuals** to ensure accuracy and reliability.
